## Timing and throughput distributions

| Measurement | Unit | Runs | Min | Median | p95 | Max | Mean | Population std dev |

Raw samples are preserved in the JSON result under each distribution's `samples` field.

## Memory observations

Memory categories are reported separately and must not be summed.

| Category | Samples | Baseline bytes (min) | Maximum observed bytes (max) | Availability / sampling limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| nodeHeap | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a Node.js process.; No samples were available. |
| nodeRss | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a Node.js process.; No samples were available. |
| nodeExternal | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a Node.js process.; No samples were available. |
| browserJsHeap | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a browser JavaScript environment.; No samples were available. |
| wasmLinearMemory | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process and does not use WebAssembly linear memory.; No samples were available. |
| pythonHeap | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a Python allocator.; No samples were available. |
| processRss | 5 | 0 | 2441216 | available; A separate, untimed /usr/bin/time-wrapped repetition's whole-process maximum resident set size; it includes process startup, argument parsing, the Rust runtime, and the entire scan, and cannot isolate steady-state or Rust-only memory. |
| streamingBuffer | 0 | — | — | The CLI's standard-input path streams through the incremental core, but the public contract exposes no retained plaintext buffer size.; No samples were available. |

Observed maxima are sampled observations, not guaranteed true peaks.
