## Timing and throughput distributions

| Measurement | Unit | Runs | Min | Median | p95 | Max | Mean | Population std dev |

Raw samples are preserved in the JSON result under each distribution's `samples` field.

## Memory observations

Memory categories are reported separately and must not be summed.

| Category | Samples | Baseline bytes (min) | Maximum observed bytes (max) | Availability / sampling limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| browserJsHeap | 0 | — | — | The Rust library does not run inside a browser JavaScript heap.; No samples were available. |
| nodeExternal | 0 | — | — | The Rust library has no Node external-memory category.; No samples were available. |
| nodeHeap | 0 | — | — | The Rust library does not run inside a Node.js heap.; No samples were available. |
| nodeRss | 0 | — | — | The Rust library does not run inside a Node.js process.; No samples were available. |
| processRss | 5 | 4431872 | 4493312 | available; Sampled immediately before and after processing; short-lived peaks between those boundaries may be missed, so maxima are observed samples, not guaranteed true peaks. |
| pythonHeap | 0 | — | — | The Rust library does not run inside a Python allocator.; No samples were available. |
| streamingBuffer | 0 | — | — | The public incremental session exposes lifecycle state but intentionally does not expose retained plaintext buffer size.; No samples were available. |
| wasmLinearMemory | 0 | — | — | The Rust library surface does not use WebAssembly linear memory.; No samples were available. |

Observed maxima are sampled observations, not guaranteed true peaks.
