## Timing and throughput distributions

| Measurement | Unit | Runs | Min | Median | p95 | Max | Mean | Population std dev |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Initialization | milliseconds | 5 | 0.008541 | 0.012 | 0.085166 | 0.085166 | 0.025883200000000002 | 0.029677052437194637 |
| Steady-state processing | milliseconds | 5 | 403.647541 | 405.088917 | 464.69458299999997 | 464.69458299999997 | 416.6443332 | 24.034068141444546 |
| Throughput | bytes-per-second | 5 | 564142.5779219811 | 647151.7461930463 | 649462.6459275271 | 649462.6459275271 | 631136.526675706 | 33513.42453355961 |

Raw samples are preserved in the JSON result under each distribution's `samples` field.

## Memory observations

Memory categories are reported separately and must not be summed.

| Category | Samples | Baseline bytes (min) | Maximum observed bytes (max) | Availability / sampling limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| browserJsHeap | 0 | — | — | The Rust library does not run inside a browser JavaScript heap.; No samples were available. |
| nodeExternal | 0 | — | — | The Rust library has no Node external-memory category.; No samples were available. |
| nodeHeap | 0 | — | — | The Rust library does not run inside a Node.js heap.; No samples were available. |
| nodeRss | 0 | — | — | The Rust library does not run inside a Node.js process.; No samples were available. |
| processRss | 5 | 3571712 | 3686400 | available; Sampled immediately before and after processing; short-lived peaks between those boundaries may be missed, so maxima are observed samples, not guaranteed true peaks. |
| pythonHeap | 0 | — | — | The Rust library does not run inside a Python allocator.; No samples were available. |
| streamingBuffer | 0 | — | — | The public incremental session exposes lifecycle state but intentionally does not expose retained plaintext buffer size.; No samples were available. |
| wasmLinearMemory | 0 | — | — | The Rust library surface does not use WebAssembly linear memory.; No samples were available. |

Observed maxima are sampled observations, not guaranteed true peaks.
