## Timing and throughput distributions

| Measurement | Unit | Runs | Min | Median | p95 | Max | Mean | Population std dev |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Initialization | milliseconds | 5 | 2.0680419999999913 | 2.18112499999998 | 2.3360000000000127 | 2.3360000000000127 | 2.197725199999995 | 0.10416870930832121 |
| Steady-state processing | milliseconds | 5 | 47.851207999999986 | 48.16254199999997 | 57.333292 | 57.333292 | 50.22409179999998 | 3.613878074578643 |
| Throughput | bytes-per-second | 5 | 4572456.7847944265 | 5443109.709616244 | 5478524.178532757 | 5478524.178532757 | 5244394.648808031 | 343529.7235769567 |

Raw samples are preserved in the JSON result under each distribution's `samples` field.

## Memory observations

Memory categories are reported separately and must not be summed.

| Category | Samples | Baseline bytes (min) | Maximum observed bytes (max) | Availability / sampling limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| nodeHeap | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a Node.js process.; No samples were available. |
| nodeRss | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a Node.js process.; No samples were available. |
| nodeExternal | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a Node.js process.; No samples were available. |
| browserJsHeap | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a browser JavaScript environment.; No samples were available. |
| wasmLinearMemory | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process and does not use WebAssembly linear memory.; No samples were available. |
| pythonHeap | 0 | — | — | The CLI is a native process, not a Python allocator.; No samples were available. |
| processRss | 5 | 0 | 2277376 | available; A separate, untimed /usr/bin/time-wrapped repetition's whole-process maximum resident set size; it includes process startup, argument parsing, the Rust runtime, and the entire scan, and cannot isolate steady-state or Rust-only memory. |
| streamingBuffer | 0 | — | — | The CLI's standard-input path streams through the incremental core, but the public contract exposes no retained plaintext buffer size.; No samples were available. |

Observed maxima are sampled observations, not guaranteed true peaks.
