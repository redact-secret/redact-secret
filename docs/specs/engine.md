# Engine

Rules governing the shared Rust core's detection pipeline, plugin/profile contract, and cross-language binding architecture.

> Generated for [issue #597](https://github.com/redact-secret/redact-secret/issues/597) (DS6a). Each rule
> below states current behavior in the present tense and links the ADR
> (`docs/decisions/`) that decided it. An ADR records why and when; this file
> records what is true now. Per
> [`decision-decide-artifact-taxonomy-spec-routing-and-evidence-placement`](../decisions/2026-09-22-decide-artifact-taxonomy-spec-routing-and-evidence-placement.md),
> a decision that applies an existing policy to one more provider family or
> one more instance is a row here plus its supporting evidence, not a new
> ADR.

## Rules

| Rule | Governing ADR |
| --- | --- |
| One Rust core crate is shared by every language binding (JavaScript, Python, CLI) through a monorepo layout. | [Adopt a Rust-core monorepo](../decisions/2026-09-09-adopt-rust-core-monorepo.md) |
| Each language binding is a thin host adapter over the shared Rust core, not an independent reimplementation. | [Define runtime bindings](../decisions/2026-09-09-define-runtime-bindings.md) |
| Every binding is held to the same conformance corpus so detection behavior does not drift by language. | [Govern cross-language conformance](../decisions/2026-09-09-govern-cross-language-conformance.md) |
| Detector selection is scoped by a profile/pack contract (for example `full`, `common`), not by ad hoc per-caller filtering. | [Define the detector profile and pack contract](../decisions/2026-09-18-define-detector-profile-and-pack-contract.md) |
| Whole-input scan and redact operations carry an explicit default bound on buffered bytes and finding count, overridable by the caller. | [Bound whole-input operations by default](../decisions/2026-09-19-bound-whole-input-operations-by-default.md) |
| An organization may register additional detectors through a declarative ruleset contract; this narrows, but does not replace, the profile/pack contract's Non-goal on dynamic plugin loading. | [Define the declarative detector ruleset contract](../decisions/2026-09-19-define-declarative-detector-ruleset-contract.md) |
| Default-ignorable and other invisible Unicode code points are normalized out of the input before detection runs, using a generated table pinned to a fixed UCD version. | [Normalize invisible characters before detection](../decisions/2026-09-19-normalize-invisible-characters-before-detection.md) |
| When candidate findings overlap, the one with the more severe resolved policy action wins, not first-match or longest-match order. | [Resolve overlap precedence by resolved-action severity](../decisions/2026-09-19-resolve-overlap-precedence-by-resolved-action-severity.md) |
| Among overlapping candidates, the disjoint subset with the greatest total evidence weight is selected. | [Select optimal disjoint candidates by total evidence weight](../decisions/2026-09-19-select-optimal-disjoint-candidates-by-total-evidence-weight.md) |
| Base64, percent-encoded, and backslash-escaped input is not decoded before detection; decoding stays out of scope. | [Defer encoded-input decoding out of scope, with reasoning](../decisions/2026-09-20-defer-encoded-input-decoding.md) |
